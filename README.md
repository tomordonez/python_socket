# Python Socket Save Data To File

This is the code that belongs to this article:

[Using Python socket to save data stream to file](https://www.tomordonez.com/python-socket-save-data-to-file.html)

I used:

* Python3
* Linux Fedora

It creates a socket and sends a `GET` request. It returns a web page header and HTML.

It saves this data to a `txt` file.

Then I used some `regex` to extract some of the header data.
